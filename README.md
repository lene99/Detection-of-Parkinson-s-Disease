# Detection-of-Parkinsons-Disease

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement resulting in serious motor disabilities such as stiffness, dificulty with walking, balance and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin in a gradual pace and get worse over time. 

## In this project, we try to: 

### ðŸŒµ Detect and predict Parkinson's Disease through ML Models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### ðŸŒ¸ Workflow: 

1. Collate adequate amount of health data related to Parkinson Disease patients
2. Pre-process the data : Understand what different columns mean, separate the features and status (status = 1 represents Parkinson's positive, status = 0 represents healthy patient w/o Parkinson's disease)
3. Do a train/test split on the data to estimate the performance of our ML model 
4. Perform SVM model on the trained data
5. Build the predictive system once the model evaluation returns high accuracy result
